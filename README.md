Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, in this, predicting the final price of each home using Multiple Linear Regression & PCA.

So, choose SalePrice variable as Dependent variable and other 79 explanatory variables as Independent Predictor Variables. Started with Data transformation and Variable analysis.

Then, performed Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis on Principal Components to predict the correct price for each house.
